                <p>
                    Laurenti Dyogi, ABS-CBN's Head of Entertainment Production, launched the Star Hunt Academy (SHA)
                    program
                    in 2018 to nurture young Filipino talents. From 250 auditionees, the first set of female trainees
                    was
                    selected and eventually trimmed down to eight members. These trainees, including former Pinoy Big
                    Brother housemates Sheena and Gwen, were trained by local and South Korean coaches from 2018 to
                    2020.
                    The group debuted as SHA trainees in August 2019, performing at various events, including the PBB
                    Otso
                    Big Night and the 2019 Manila Southeast Asian Games thanksgiving celebration. In 2020, they
                    showcased
                    their progress through performance videos and participated in the Philippine K-pop Convention's
                    Happy
                    Hallyu Day 4 event.</p>

                    collaboration with MU Doctor Academy and South Korean music production group Vo3e. Choreographers
                    Moon
                    Yeon-joo and Kwak Seong-chan, who had worked with popular K-pop groups, created the choreography.
                    The
                    official lyric video for "Da Coconut Nut" premiered on Bini's YouTube channel on November 6, 2020,
                    followed by the music video on November 20. Bini performed "Da Coconut Nut" live for the first time
                    on

                <p>On May 4, 2021, Bini released their first official debut teaser, leading to the announcement of their
                    debut single "Born to Win," which was released on June 4. Their debut launch, "Bini: The Runway,"
                    featured a fashion and music event showcasing creations by designer Francis Libiran, followed by
                    "The
                    Showcase" on June 11, where they performed and interacted with fans. Bini performed live on ASAP and
                    participated in the Philippine K-pop Convention's Happy Hallyu Day 5 event in August. They released
                    their third single, "Kapit Lang," on September 10, and performed a modified version of "Born to Win"
                    at

                    Dubai-based magazine Xpedition, and on September 29, they released their sophomore studio album,

                <p class="my-4 h4 fw-bold">2023–present: Domestic success, "Pantropiko" craze and Talaarawan</p>
                <p>
                    In late 2023, Bini released "Karera" (Race) and "Pantropiko" (Tropical) as pre-release singles to
                    promote their first extended play (EP) Talaarawan (Diary). "Karera" became popular in school
                    graduation
                    ceremonies due to its resonant themes, while "Pantropiko" topped the Spotify Charts’ Daily Top Songs
                    for
                    the Philippines in April 2024, becoming a summer anthem. The release of Talaarawan on March 8, 2024,
                    coincided with International Women's Day, aligning with their advocacy for women's empowerment. The
                    success of "Pantropiko" was amplified by its viral TikTok dance challenge, leading to over two
                    million
                    monthly listeners on Spotify by the end of March, making Bini the highest-streamed female OPM artist
                    and
                    the most-streamed P-pop group in the country.</p>
                <p>
                    In 2024, Bini announced their first major solo concert, "BINIverse," at the New Frontier Theater,
                    celebrating their third anniversary. Tickets sold out quickly, prompting additional dates and calls
                    for
                    a larger venue, with all dates eventually selling out. The concert’s third day was announced to be
                    streamed on iWantTFC. Bini also guested on the Chinese reality show Show It All and announced their
                    first North American tour, with stops in Vancouver, Edmonton, Winnipeg, and Toronto. In June, they
                    entered the Top Artists Global chart on Spotify, launched their website, and announced a new single,
                    "Cherry on Top," set for release in July. They celebrated their third anniversary with "National
                    Happy
                    BINI Day" and performed at Philippine independence festivities, although the performance was cut
                    short
                    due to safety concerns. Bini topped Spotify's Daily Top Artists Philippines chart, surpassing Taylor
                    Swift, and held a successful marathon event titled the “BINI Run” in Manila.</p>
